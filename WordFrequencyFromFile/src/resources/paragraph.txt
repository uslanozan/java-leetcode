In 1980, ex-convict Cuban refugee Tony Montana arrives in Miami as part of the Mariel boatlift with his friend Manny Ribera and their companions, Angel and Chi-Chi. Miami drug lord Frank Lopez arranges green cards for them in exchange for killing a former henchman for Fidel Castro. Dissatisfied with their jobs as restaurant dishwashers, Tony and Manny meet with Frank's right-hand man, Omar Suarez, who sends the four to purchase cocaine from Colombian dealers. Tony and Angel are taken at gunpoint; Tony is made to watch as Angel is dismembered with a chainsaw, before Manny and Chi-Chi rescue them. They kill three of the dealers and deliver the drugs and money to Frank in person, suspecting Omar set them up.

Tony and Manny work for Frank while Tony is attracted to Frank's wife, Elvira. Tony visits his mother, and sister Gina. Tony gives his mother $1,000, claiming he earns money as a political organizer. Tony's mother sees through the lie and disowns him, but Gina keeps the money. Tony warns Manny to stay away from Gina. Frank sends Tony and Omar to Bolivia to meet cocaine kingpin Alejandro Sosa. Omar is angered when Tony seeks to negotiate a large deal without Frank's approval. Sosa has his men hang Omar from a helicopter, telling Tony that Omar is a police informant and that Frank has poor judgment for trusting him. Tony says he never trusted Omar. Sosa agrees to the deal and warns Tony never to betray him.

Tony sets up his own cocaine operation. Mel Bernstein, a corrupt detective on Frank's payroll, attempts to extort Tony for police protection. While at a club, Tony finds Gina having sex with a man in a bathroom and assaults them both, then escapes an attempt on his life by two hitmen. He confronts Frank and Bernstein over the attack, forcing Frank to confess that he set it up, then has Manny shoot Frank and kills Bernstein himself. Tony marries Elvira and becomes the distributor of Sosa's product, constructing a large, heavily guarded estate to oversee his rapidly growing empire.

In 1983, Tony is caught in an FBI sting operation and charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Sosa offers to keep Tony out of prison via his government connections if Tony assists in the murder of a journalist about to expose Sosa. During a restaurant dinner, a drunken Tony blames Manny for his arrest and calls Elvira an infertile junkie, prompting Elvira to call out his criminality to the other patrons and leave him. Sosa's henchman, "Shadow", puts a radio-controlled bomb under the journalist's car, but Tony tries to cancel the hit upon seeing the journalist accompanied by his wife and children. Shadow refuses and Tony kills him before he can detonate the bomb. Sosa vows revenge for Tony allowing the journalist to deliver the expos√©.

At his mother's behest, Tony, high on cocaine, tracks down Gina and finds her with Manny. Tony shoots Manny dead before learning Gina has just married him. Tony takes Gina to his estate and begins a cocaine binge in his office. As Sosa's men invade the estate and begin killing the guards, Gina accuses Tony of wanting her for himself. She shoots and wounds him, and is then killed by one of Sosa's men whom Tony kills in turn. Seeking vengeance, he opens fire on the group using an M16 rifle equipped with an M203 grenade launcher, killing many of them but sustaining multiple gunshot wounds. As he taunts his attackers, Sosa's enforcer shoots him in the back and kills him. Tony's body falls off the balcony and into a pool near the base of a statue displaying the motto "The World Is Yours."
